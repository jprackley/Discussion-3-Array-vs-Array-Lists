# Discussion-3-Array-vs-Array-Lists
## In Java Arrays and Array Lists allow for storing multiple values or user inputs as 
## elements into a single variable instead of creating multiple variables to store the 
## inputs. The elements in both an Array and an Array List can be accessed by calling 
## their index postition. 

###Here are some important differences.

### Arrays:
-Arrays are fixed in size and can not be resized
 after they are initialized.
-Removing, Adding, and Inserting elements into an Array is more difficult and requires the use of loops or creating new Arrays.

### Array Lists:
-Array Lists are dynamic and can be resized as new elements are added or removed.
-Array Lists come with methods that allow for easier manipulation of the Array Lists such and .add(), .set(), and .remove().
